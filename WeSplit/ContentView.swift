 Random Stuff:
 Modifying Program State:
 A state is the active collection of settings that define the current position an app is in; this is how games save data so you can return where you left off
 "Views are a function of their state" - what can be interacted with is based on the current state
 
 Binding State to User Interface Controls:
 The "$" works with "@State" to allow any user input to update along with the view
 
 Creating Views a Loop:
